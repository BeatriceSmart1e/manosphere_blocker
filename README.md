# Say Goodbye to the Sigmas - an extension to block harmful manosphere content.
Myself and my wonderful partner Am√©lie Nolan have entered BTYS (in Ireland) as a group, and are working on a cool project which looks into the harmful effects of manosphere content on (mainly) adolescent boys.

A major part of that is our extension. If you're interested in the project as a whole, feel free to visit [our website!](https://guidetothemanosphere.com)
